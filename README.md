Supplementary material &amp; dataset tracking

HCM_GWAS_summary_stats.xlsx : This thesis utilised the lead variants for each of the 68 loci from the HCM GWAS summary input data (Tadros et al., 2025).

data_tracking_sheet_for_thesis.xlsx : A detailed dataset tracking sheet capturing the chromatin datasets used in Chapter 4: Variant Prioritisation. This includes ATAC-Seq, DNase-Seq, Histone ChIP, and ChIP TF datasets leveraged for input to deep learning. The tracking sheet outlines which tissues and cell types were captured and in which sections of the thesis they were used. 

proximity_based_bulk_LV_qa_plots.zip : a zipped folder containing 68 figures pertaining to the 68 HCM loci - each figure showcases a quadrant plot visualisation (as performed in Chapter 3: Gene Prioritisation) having leveraged GTEx bulk heart LV tissue expression data (whereby each locus was defined via the proximity-based approach).

tad_based_sc_CM_qa_plots.zip : a zipped folder containing 68 figures pertaining to the 68 HCM loci - each figure showcases a quadrant plot visualisation (as performed in Chapter 3: Gene Prioritisation) having leveraged single-cell heart cardiomyocyte expression data (whereby each locus was defined via the TAD-based approach).

ALPK3_RAF1_missense_variants_for_PyMOL_visualisations.xlsx : a spreadsheet detailing which missense variants were plotted in PyMOL for both ALPK3 and RAF1 (in Chapter 3: Gene Prioritisation). 

prioritised_variants_VEP_output.xlsx : After employing Deepmind's Enformer in Chapter 4: Variant Prioritisation, each of the 53 prioritised variants are shown alongside their VEP output.
